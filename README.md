# Widget For Google Analytics

<b>Goal:</b> Create a personal widget for tracking certain Google Analytics metrics that are of interest to me on a daily basis. If time permits, I may expand this into a full, published app that can be used by other developers as well.

This project is still in its very early stages, but this is what the widget looks like at the moment:
